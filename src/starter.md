# Profilie Starter Kit

Profilie is a simple-to-use service that requires no installation or downloads. 
It allows you to easily host your project anywhere—whether on **GitHub Pages**, **Cloudflare Pages**, or **GitLab Pages**.

All you need is a **basic configuration file**, a **homepage**, and a **404 page**, and your **social profile** will be ready **in no time**.

---

## **Getting Started**

To begin with Profilie, we've prepared a **ready-to-use [Starter Kit](https://github.com/profilie/starter)**.

If your project is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, simply click the **Use this template** button to create your own copy of the repository.  

Once you've duplicated the template, navigate to `config.js` and **customize it** to suit your preferences.  

You can also edit `index.html` to **modify the site title, meta tags,** and other elements to **personalize your profile**.

---

## **Config File**

The `config.js` file is the **heart of your website** — it's what the entire site is built on.  

This JavaScript file allows you to **customize** key aspects of your site, including:

- **Title**
- **Icon**
- **Description**
- **Footer**

---

## **Troubleshooting**

If your `config.js` file isn't correctly configured, you might encounter a **JavaScript Loading Error: 722**.
