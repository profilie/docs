## Step 1: Create Your Config File

Start by creating a file named `config.js` in your project root directory.

Next, visit the [**Configuration Guide**](/configuration/config), copy the content provided there, and paste it into your `config.js`.  

Feel free to **customize** this fileâ€”add your social media handles, set your username, and tailor it to your preferences. This is your personal setup!

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Homepage

After configuring `config.js`, create an `index.html` file to serve as your website's homepage.  

You can find a helpful template and instructions in our [**Homepage Guide**](/configuration/homepage).

## Step 3: Create a 404 Page

A **404 page** is your website's way of telling visitors that the page theyâ€™re looking for doesnâ€™t exist.  

Since Profilie is a **single-page website**, we highly recommend creating a custom 404 page to improve user experience.  

Learn more about creating your 404 page in our [**404 Page Guide**](/configuration/404-page).

## Step 4: Launch Your Profilie Website

Once everything is configured, itâ€™s time to **deploy** your website!  

Get ready to share your profile with the worldâ€”exciting times ahead! ðŸ¥³
